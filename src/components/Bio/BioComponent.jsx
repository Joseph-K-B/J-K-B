                With a passion for creativity, design, and problem solving, 
                software development is one of my many pursuits. Utilizing a full tech stack 
                and test driven development, reliable and accessible software is merely a module away.
                While software development might be my focus, the arts are very close to me. 
                As a musician I developed my interest in patterns and language which keeps me curious within the field. 
                Through graphic forms of art I have an eye for visually appealing design. 
                As a self proclaimed environmentalist, I've fostered a deep desire to contribute to progress.
                All of these interests and traits I extend into my software development coupled with a love of learning,
                I feel right at home in this field
