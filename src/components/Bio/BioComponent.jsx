                With a passion for creativity, design, and problem solving, 
                software development is one of my many pursuits. Utilizing a full tech stack 
                and test driven development, reliable and accessible software is merely a module away.
                While software development might be my focus, the arts are very close to me. 
                As a musician I developed my interest in patterns and language at an early age which keeps me curious within the field.
